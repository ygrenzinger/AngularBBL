AngularBBL
==========

This is the code used to do the Angular Brown Bag Lunch and present the Javascript MVC framework.

For using this code, you have first to install npm module with 'npm install' and js components with bower install.
You have to launch a mongo database and then you can launch the back server with 'node server/server.js' and the app with 'grunt server'.
For the tests, launch 'scripts/web-server.js' and then 'scripts/e2e-test.sh'.

If you have any problem, tell me.

The launch config will be improved .. someday :)
